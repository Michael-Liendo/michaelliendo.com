        My name is Michael Liendo and I am a web developer. I enjoy using my
        skills and knowledge to create, improve, and complete projects, with the
        goal of learning more and more. I became intrigued by this world at the
        end of 2018 and from then on, I am what I am now, getting better and
        better every day, to complete my goal of being at my peak.
